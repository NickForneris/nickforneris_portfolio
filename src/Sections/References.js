Nick's ability to listen to a problem and drive digital solutions and efficiencies that fit the need and are simple to use are second to none. The solutions he comes up with keep the end user in mind and ensure those users have a user friendly environment to work within. Nick's listens to your needs and what the potential solutions are and provides quick feedback on your solution as well as other options that may fit the need. Nick listens to user feedback and quickly applies solutions that address those issues. Nick's ability to teach people the functionality of the digital tools he creates is a huge asset as well. To be able to apply digital solutions and to explain those solutions in simple terms for the end users is highly valuable. Nick is excellent at working in a collaborative environment to address problems. He would be an asset to any team.

I had the privilege to work with Nick on a major IT improvement project and throughout the whole process, Nick exhibited his ability to pick new technical knowledge up quickly. He has solid knowledge on developing digital tools on various platforms and strives to use technology to alleviate pain points of users. More importantly, he was able to take in constructive feedback and further improve his codes. Nick's competencies would definitely be of great value in any team or organisation.

Nick’s passion towards developing digital tools that are simple to use for the end user is only outpaced by his ability to apply feedback received during the testing phases of his digital creations. He genuinely listens and applies feedback received to help improve the digital experience for the user. Most of these changes occurring in real time which provides a positive experience for the user and helps with “buy in” for his solutions. Nick’s ability to think creatively in regards to digital solutions is a much needed asset to be able to nimbly navigate digital solutions.
